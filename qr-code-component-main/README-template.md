### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

I learned how to use flexbox.

```css
body {
        
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
      }

      .main-container {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        
      }

```

### Continued development


I want to continue focusing on and growing my css skills. It was an easy task but i struggled a bit with some CSS concepts like Flexbox and how to center a div, lol but I leveraged the power of google to help me when I was stuck. I would love to further strengthen my knowledge on the use of CSS Flexbox and Grid.
